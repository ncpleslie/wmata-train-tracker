# WMATA Train Tracker Vue Frontend

This is the Vue frontend for the WMATA Train Tracker application.

This Vue code is expected to be run by the Wails application. Wails will generated the required methods when `wails dev` is run.

Steps on how to run this Vue 3 code can be found in the parent [README](../README.md#wails-development).

The Vue components are also exported and used by the Nuxt 3 application. This is to allow for a consistent UI between the Wails application and the Nuxt website.
